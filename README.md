Creating a portfolio website using react and 3js

The goal of this project is to learn react and 3js, as well as continue to develop my skills from my girlfriend website project. 

This project will have several parts:
* home page
* projects page
* about page

What each page will have is to tbd, but I do want some of my youtube videos to be embeded into projects page.

Adding more to readme to make sure git is properly setup on my personal computer
